# Twitter Fact Checking Bot

Hello, welcome to the Twitter fact checking bot :) 

Since fact checking is currently not en vouge, we build a bot to take over the role. the bot takes the tweet it is mentioned on and checks it for accuracy using state-of-the-art LLMs. If the bot is unsure, it will search the web for up-to-date information. Therefore, it is using the DuckDuckGoGo API for preserving privacy.

### Usage
To active the bot please tag the bot on a tweet that you want to fact check and get an as objective as possible fact check.

The bot is fully open source and feel free to fork and adjust. It is build using the LangChain framework.

### Adjusting the bot
If you want to run the bot yourself, please check the upstream repo for instructions.
